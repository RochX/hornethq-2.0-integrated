# Hornet HQ 2.0 Integrated
This is the repository for the integrated design of Hornet HQ 2.0.
The project is to recreate the [Hornet HQ](https://hornethq.kzoo.edu) web application, which is what Kalamazoo College students and faculty use for many college aspects such as class registration, academic advising, and time entry for student employees.

This repository is the "integrated" version as it is combining the [unified design](https://github.com/RochX/hornethq-2.0-unified-design) and the [dashboard design](https://github.com/mpukabaofficial/dashboard/) for the frontend.
It also implements the backend developed by another group of students.
This backend allows us to pull real course data given to us by Kalamazoo College Information Services.

Hornet HQ as it stands has many issues for current students, such as the course catalog being hard to search and navigate through and important information being buried under layers of tabs and buttons.

By redesigning Hornet HQ, we wish to highlight these current issues and provide prototypes on possible solutions.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
